# Spidermap Application for American Airlines

## To do:
  - Fix to use system fonts when exporting jpg/png image
  - <MyMaps> component was updated to update an existing spidermap in edit mode and posts a new map entry if the id does not exist -- update point-to-point map and <GlobalMaps> component to reflect this update as well
  - need a constant SET_POINTMAP_CURRENTLY_EDITING to track any pointmap id
